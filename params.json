But subsequently opening it will be fast.\r\n\r\nThis also reduces bandwidth consumption greatly. This in turn improves performance for other users when multiple users are sharing the same WAN connection.\r\n\r\n### What do you mean Compression?\r\n\r\nBy compressing the X11 pixmaps/bitmaps, via either lossy or lossless compression, performance is also improved for the user.\r\n\r\nThe 2 most common compression methods are JPEG (lossy) and PNG (lossless.)\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if your system libraries (like libjpegturbo) support SIMD acceleration, then Xccc benefits from it.\r\n\r\nThis also reduces bandwidth consumption, which in turn improves performance for other users sharing the same WAN connection.\r\n\r\n### What do you mean short-Circuiting?\r\nWe can't tell you; that is our secret sauce!\r\n\r\n### sudo What do you mean short-Circuiting?\r\nOK\r\n\r\nXccc eliminates most of the X11 round-trips. This improves performance, even for newer toolkits.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
