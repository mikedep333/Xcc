<p>X11 Cached, Compressed and short-Circuited</p>

<h3>
<a id="this-is-only-a-proposed-re-branding" class="anchor" href="#this-is-only-a-proposed-re-branding" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>This is only a proposed re-branding!</h3>

<p>I need to gain the <a href="http://www.theopensourceway.org/book/The_Open_Source_Way-Stuff_everyone_knows_and_forgets_anyway-Seek_consensus_-_use_voting_as_a_last_resort.html">concensus</a> of the X2Go, Arctica and QVD developers 1st.</p>

<p>And the executables/libraries still have "nx" or "NX" in their names.</p>

<h3>
<a id="what-do-you-mean-caching" class="anchor" href="#what-do-you-mean-caching" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What do you mean Caching?</h3>

<p>By caching the X11 traffic, especially pixmaps/bitmaps, performance is greatly improved from a user's perspective.</p>

<p>For example, the 1st time a user opens the applications menu or opens an image, it may load a tad slowly. But subsequently opening it will be fast.</p>

<p>This also reduces bandwidth consumption greatly. This in turn improves performance for other users when multiple users are sharing the same WAN connection.</p>

<h3>
<a id="what-do-you-mean-compression" class="anchor" href="#what-do-you-mean-compression" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What do you mean Compression?</h3>

<p>By compressing the X11 pixmaps/bitmaps, via either lossy or lossless compression, performance is also improved for the user.</p>

<p>The 2 most common compression methods are JPEG (lossy) and PNG (lossless.)</p>

<p>Furthermore, if your system libraries (like libjpegturbo) support SIMD acceleration, then Xccc benefits from it.</p>

<p>This also reduces bandwidth consumption, which in turn improves performance for other users sharing the same WAN connection.</p>

<a id="what-do-you-mean-by-short-circuiting" class="anchor" href="#what-do-you-mean-by-short-circuiting" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What do you mean by short-Circuiting?</h3>

<p>We can't tell you; that is our secret sauce!</p>

<h3>
<a id="sudo-what-do-you-mean-by-short-circuiting" class="anchor" href="#sudo-what-do-you-mean-by-short-circuiting" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>sudo What do you mean by short-Circuiting?</h3>

<p>OK</p>

<p>Xccc eliminates most of the X11 round-trips. This improves performance, even for newer toolkits.</p>

<h3>
<a id="but-i-thought-that-newer-toolkits-use-xcb-and-are-therefore-unaffected-by-x11-round-trips" class="anchor" href="#but-i-thought-that-newer-toolkits-use-xcb-and-are-therefore-unaffected-by-x11-round-trips" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>But I thought that newer toolkits use XCB, and are therefore unaffected by X11 round-trips.</h3>

<p>The use of XCB does cause them to use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0zNWswcqMg">fewer</a> round-trips, and be less affected by them.</p>

<p>Emperically, they still perform much faster when Xccc eliminates most of the round-trips.</p>

<p>See X.org contributor Bart Massey's <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/343506/">explanation</a> for more info.</p>

<p>And feel free to send a PR or patch with a (link to a) better/more detailed explanation.</p>

<a id="shouldnt-it-be-xccsc" class="anchor" href="#shouldnt-it-be-xccsc" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Shouldn't it be Xccsc?</h3>

<p>We decided to short-Curcuit the s.</p>

<p>We are all about short-Circuiting!</p>

<p>Also, we wanted to limit their filenames to 8 characters.</p>

<p>Yes, however:</p>

<ol>
<li>LBX never supported caching.</li>
<li>LBX never supported lossy image compression.</li>
<li>LBX never supported short-Circuiting (eliminating the round-trips).</li>
</ol>

<a id="this-sounds-an-awful-like-like-nx-libs" class="anchor" href="#this-sounds-an-awful-like-like-nx-libs" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>This sounds an awful like like <a href="https://github.com/ArcticaProject/nx-libs">nx-libs</a>...</h3>

<p>Yes, we are rebranding nx-libs.</p>

<p>But there are technical changes:</p>

<ol>
<li>No more bundled libraries once 3.6.0 is released! (The 3.6.x branch currently has most of them removed.)</li>
<li>We are adding new features like replacing TCP sockets with UNIX sockets.</li>
<li>Seriously, do you have any idea <a href="http://www.theopensourceway.org/book/The_Open_Source_Way-How_to_tell_if_a_FLOSS_project_is_doomed_to_FAIL.html">how bad</a> bundled libraries are? Some of them were <em>modified</em> too.</li>
</ol>

<p>The rebranding is necessary for other reasons too:</p>

<ol>
<li>We do not want to be associated with NoMachine NX3. We are not just maintaining a legacy branch; we are actively developing the codebase.</li>
<li>NoMachine 4 takes a fundamentally different appraoch with server-side-rendering via video codecs, even for 2D apps.</li>
<li>"nx-libs" is confusing. We provide 2 executables (Xccagent and Xccproxy) in addition to the libraries.</li>
<li>We do not want people to think that they have to link against our GPLv2 code in order to use Xccc. For most users, calling Xcccagent and Xcccproxy, and possibly re-embedding them, will be sufficient.</li>
<li>We want to have fundamentally different policies to working with upstream X.org. Hopefully <a href="http://community.redhat.com/blog/2015/03/upstream-first-turning-openstack-into-an-nfv-platform/">"Upstream First"</a>, but we need to reach <a href="http://www.theopensourceway.org/book/The_Open_Source_Way-Stuff_everyone_knows_and_forgets_anyway-Seek_consensus_-_use_voting_as_a_last_resort.html">concensus</a> on that 1st.</li>
<li>It is too difficult to try to rework the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NX_technology">"NX technology" wikipedia page</a> to separate nx-libs 3 vs NX 3 vs NX4. I would rather perform the rebranding, create an Xccc page, and then update the NX page. And this highlights the larger communication that we have.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=655699">The specter of bundled libraries</a> still haunts nx-libs.</li>
</ol>
